            Chennai,formerly known as Madras,is the capital and largest city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India.
             It is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census, 
             Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration. 
             Incorporated in 1688, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in India 
             and the second oldest in the world after London. Historically, the region was part of 
             the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms during various eras. 
             The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company 
             from the Nayak ruler Chennapa Nayaka in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and port 
             and built Fort St. George, the first British fortress in India. The city was made the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, 
             a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained independence in 1947,
             Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. 
             The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996.
